This is a repository with some notebooks with illustrations of some Deep Learning principles, to help with study this subject.

[TF-logreg.ipynb](TF-logreg.ipynb) is an example of implementation of Logistic Regression in Tensorflow.

[TF-logreg-nobias.ipynb](TF-logreg-nobias.ipynb) - same but w/o bias (bias=0)

[pytorch-speech-recognition.ipynb](pytorch-speech-recognition.ipynb) - Solution for one class Homework (name of the class withheld in order to not make it easier for other students to discover

[PyTorch-activations-demo.ipynb](PyTorch-activations-demo.ipynb) - This is a demo notebook for different activation, optimizers and number of neuron in a hidden layer with MLP on a nonlinearly-separated dataset. 

[MNIST-cv-techniques.ipynb](MNIST-cv-techniques.ipynb) - MNIST using features made with OpenCV (No Neural Nerworks).

[Cats-vs-dogs-VGG16.ipynb](Cats-vs-dogs-VGG16.ipynb) - famouse competition for classification using pre-trained VGG!6 (illustration of transfer learning)
